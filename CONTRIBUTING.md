# Contributing to ng-seed/universal

We would love for you to contribute to **`ng-seed/universal`** and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor,
here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature requests](#feature)
 - [Submission guidelines](#submit)
 - [Coding rules](#rules)
 - [Commit message guidelines](#commit)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep **`ng-seed/universal`** open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].

Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub Repository.

If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that
we can use it.

Please consider what kind of change it is:
* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change
so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission guidelines
### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion
might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order
to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using http://plnkr.co.

Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional
questions like:
- version used
- 3rd-party libraries and their versions
- and most importantly: a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduce scenario using http://plnkr.co/ allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as
well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem. If plunker is not a suitable way to demonstrate the problem (*ex:
issues related to our npm packaging*), please create a standalone git repository demonstrating the problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more
bugs.

Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand
that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate
the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you,
we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/ng-seed/universal/issues/new).

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/ng-seed/universal/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:
     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```
* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Follow our [Coding rules](#rules).
* Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit).
  Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.
* Push your branch to GitHub:
    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```
* In GitHub, send a pull request to `universal:master`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):
    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```
That's it, thanks for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged
After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:
* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:
    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```
* Check out the master branch:
    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```
* Delete the local branch:
    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```
* Update your master with the latest upstream version:
    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:
* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**. (Details TBC).
* We follow [fulls1z3's Angular TSLint rules][angular-tslint-rules].

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit message guidelines
We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that
are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also, we use the git commit messages to **generate
the `ng-seed/universal` change log**.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes
a **type**, an *optional* **scope** (*when applicable*) and a **subject**:
#### Without scope
```
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
#### With scope
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as
well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/ng-seed/universal/commits/master))
```
docs(changelog): update change log to alpha.4
```
```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm, webpack)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, etc)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

* **packaging**: used for changes that change the package layout (*e.g. package.json, bundles, path changes, etc.*)
* **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:
* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include
the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that
this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit
message is then used for this.
